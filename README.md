# Skin-Lesion-Segmentation-Using-Deep-Learning
This project is a Flask web application that uses a pre-trained UNet model to perform image segmentation, allowing users to upload images, process them, and receive segmented images highlighting specific areas of interest (e.g., skin lesions) in real-time.
